# OpenShift-in-100-Days

Welcome to 100 Days Of OpenShift!

100 Days of OpenShift is the challenge in which we aim to learn something new related to OpenShift each day across 100 Days!!!

I started this challenge as i had purchased all the RedHat OpenShift exam coupons and it is about to expire in less than 100 days, so i want to not waste those coupons and take those exams and i have no motivation to do so, that's why this challenge is to see myself through.


By this challenge, i will add notes and learnings daily as per my understanding of OpenShift.


I welcome everyone to join me on this challenge. You can ping me or give a follow on below platform i will definitely reply.
